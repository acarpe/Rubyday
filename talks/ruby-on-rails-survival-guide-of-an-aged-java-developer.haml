					%p		
						Switching to ruby language and to the rails framework can be puzzling if you come from a deep java background knowledge.

						"How can I...? How do I...?" are the most common question during the ramp up period of the learning curve and there is a good chance to get lost in the big "cave of the gems".
					%p
						In this talk I'll try to explain the tips and tricks a java developer should know to avoid some common pitfalls and deliver his first rails project on time.
