					%p		
						When I started to learn Ruby, I was awed by the code of experienced rubyists. That code was full of amazing magic tricks that I could barely understand. People called those tricks metaprogramming.
					%p
						With time, I found that metaprogramming sits right at the core of Ruby. To really understand Ruby, I had to understand all those scary tricks! Feeling like a sorcerer's apprentice, I set out to write a Spell Book of metaprogramming techniques. Once I'd finished the Spell Book, metaprogramming didn't seem like black magic anymore. Instead, it just felt like any other set of techniques.
					%p
						In this talk, I'll show you the content of my Spell Book, so that you don't have to go through the trouble of writing one yourself.
